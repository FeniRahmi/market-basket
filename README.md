# market-basket
This project is about market basket analysis which allows us to identify the relationship between different combinations of products that users buy.

At Shopee, sellers list thousands of products for sale on our platform. A better understanding of users' tastes and preferences for products can help Shopee design better promotions and recommendations for our users. To do that, we conduct market basket analysis which allows us to identify the relationship between different combinations of products that users buy. We are interested in finding association rules between combinations of different products. These association rules can help to uncover regularities in purchasing behaviors of our users. Confidence is a measure that is used to indicate such tendencies and can be used to determine the association for varying numbers of products. For the purpose of this question, we will be using confidence to calculate the association for 2 products and 3 products.
